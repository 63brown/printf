This is our first team project as ALX Software Engineering students.

This team consists of Brian Kip who is clearly a football lover, Mumbi who loves watching series and Wabi Sherie - definitely a music lover :smile:  .

Our project contains code where we write functions and programs in C.

We have already been provided with example source code. Our task is to create algorithms and programs that ensure the program runs successfully without segmentation fault ;-) and most importantly

to ensure correct output.

We learned about collaborating in github a while ago so it will be interesting to apply the knowledge of pushing and pulling branches!
